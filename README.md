# National-Lottery-Simulation
A software app game that allows you to play the Bulgarian national lottery. Full description is in the "About" section in the game.
Note: This code uses a .exe file for execution. So it can't be run on Linux. If you want to, though, you can use WineHQ.
(UPDATE: The below issue is no longer present. However, a .zip with all the sound effects
needs to be downloaded and they need to be kept in the same folder as the application file.)
When you run this programme, please turn off the sound using the icon in
the top left corner of the main game window before you start playing until further
notice. The program simply crashes as the directory path specified for the resource files
is hardcoded and doesn't work cross-platform. The sounds used are all public domain
material and aren't essential to the playthrough of the game. They are simply there
for "flashiness", more impressive UID and improved user experience. This issue will
be fixed shortly.
Most of the content is archived files of the previous versions of this program.
The only files worth looking at otherwise are "Execute_NLS_In_Full.zip", which you
should download if you want to experience the sound design I implemented,
the "National_Lottery_Simulation.exe" file, which you can download if you don't pay
the sound design any heed (make sure to turn it off before playing!) and
if you only want to execute the programme, and the "Download_To_View_Code.zip" file,
which would be useful if you want to have to have an in-depth look at the code.
All of the .cs and .Designer.cs files also deserve a special mention, as they keep track
of my updates on the code. They're located in the "WindowsFormsApplication1" folder.
